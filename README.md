# endaoment-subgraph
Subgraph for the Endaoment Protocol

## Local Development
This section covers how to run the subgraph locally

### Requirements
[//]: # (TODO: Figure out if I can bundle the hardhat node here. That's probably the best move instead of making it running a requirement)

1. Docker is installed and running
2. Have node running on `0.0.0.0:8545`

### Steps
1. Run `yarn docker-up`
2. Run `yarn create-local`
3. Run `yarn deploy-local`
